Products or services using maps derived from indoor= and OpenMapTiles schema need to visibly
credit "IndoorEqual.org" and "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "indoor=" and "OpenMapTiles" with a link to
https://indoorequal.org/ and http://openmaptiles.org/.

For a browsable electronic map based on indoor=, OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the
credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[© indoor=](https://indoorequal.org/) [© OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/) [© OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual
description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.
